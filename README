Real Computer Monitoring Block 
http://www.ivancreations.com/2013/07/real-computer-monitoring-block-detailed.html

In order to make the thing work one needs to:
* Following hardware
  [required] Mini USB cable
  [required] https://www.olimex.com/Products/Duino/PIC32/PIC32-T795/open-source-hardware - to connect to the PC and receive data via USB from the PC
  [required] https://www.olimex.com/Products/Modules/LED/MOD-LED8x8RGB/open-source-hardware - to receive data via SPI from the T795 
  [required] https://www.olimex.com/Products/PIC/Programmers/PIC-KIT3/ - to program the T795 board
  [required] Breadboard with 830 holes. The power lines shall NOT NOT NOT NOT be running along the entire board, but be separated in two halfs.
  [required] 40 male to male dupoint wires
  [required] solder, flux and of course: Soldering iron.
  [optional] https://www.olimex.com/Products/Modules/Interface/MOD-USB-RS232/open-source-hardware - to have an output console from the T795 to the PC (very usefull for debugging)
  
* The software from this repo

How to cook:
Put T795 board on the beginning of the bread board. NOTE THE POLARITY of the power lines!
Start your soldering iron 
Take a look at the /docs/connections.png and solder a wire on the same point the CURLY ORANGE wire is soldered
Activate supply rail 5V : Put the other end at the SECOND half of the bread board - that is to supply 5V for the RBG matrix (it will work on 3V3 from the main rail of the T795 board but the leds will be dimmer)
Activate GROUND rail 5V : Connect the ground rail of the T795 board to the SECOND half of the bread board (the blue line next to the orange one)
Connect LATCH on RGB to PIN 41 on T795 
Connect DATA on RGB to PIN 40 on T795 
Connect SCK on RGB to PIN 38 on T795 
Connect VCC of RGB to supply rail 5V (that you activated earlier)
Connect GND of RGB to GROUND rail 5V (that you activated earlier) 
Connect GND of RGB to GROUND rail 5V 

Connect T795 board to the PC using the MiniUSB cable
Use the PIC-KIT3 programmer and MPLABX IDE to burn the HEX file located in /uc/firmware to the T795 board
Wait for the T795 green and yellow leds to start blinking

Open eclipse and import the eclipse project from /pc folder 
Run the ReCoMonBMainFrame class

If you wish to have the PC software run standalone then run the ExportJar.xml ant script and then take the contents of the export directory.
Use the appropriate script to start the ReCoMonB PC software depending on yout OS
